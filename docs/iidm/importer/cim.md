ENTSO-E approved the first version of the CIM based data exchange specification for grid models in 2009, based on IEC
CIM14 (UML14v02) and known as ENTSO-E Profile 1.

Profile 1 is currently valid for ENTSO-E data exchanges until an approved version of the [CGMES](cgmes.md) is implemented
and comes into force. The ENTSO-E CIM Profile 1 defines how ENTSO-E members, using software from different vendors, will
exchange grid modelling information as required by ENTSO-E and TSO business activities.

To facilitate the implementation of this specification, in the period 2013-2014, the ENTSO-E CIM Profile 1 document was
revised to include the agreements reached in the interoâ€‹perability test 2013 which were published as separate annex to
the specification.
